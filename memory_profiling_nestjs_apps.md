# How to profile the memory usage of a Nest js app

> Author: [Amjad Hossain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-amjad-hossain-rahat/)

In order to ensure that our NestJS application is running optimally, we can use memory profiling to identify potential memory leaks and other memory-related issues. This guide will walk you through how to perform memory profiling for your NestJS app with V8.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v10 or higher)
- NestJS (v6 or higher)
- Chrome browser (v66 or higher)

## Installing the Dependencies

First, we need to install `v8-profiler` and `v8` modules which allows us to generate memory profiles for our application. You can use either of these two modules. 

```bash
npm install v8-profiler
npm install v8
```
or
```bash
yarn add v8-profiler
yarn add v8
```

## Enabling the Profiler in the app

We need to add a new endpoint to our application that will trigger the profiler. Add the following code to your controller:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as profiler from 'v8-profiler';
import v8 from 'v8';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Get('/profile/memory/v8-profiler')
  async profileMemory(): Promise<string> {
    profiler.startProfiling('memory');
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
    const profile = profiler.stopProfiling('memory');
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      profile.export((error, result) => {
        profile.delete();
        return resolve(JSON.stringify(result));
      });
    });
  }

  @Get('/profile/memory/v8')
  async profileMemory(): Promise<string> {
    const snapshot = await v8.getHeapSnapshot();
    const profile = JSON.stringify(snapshot);
    return profile;
  }
}
```

In this code, we are creating a new endpoint at `/profile/memory` that will trigger the profiler. When this endpoint is accessed, the profiler will start profiling the memory usage of our application for `5 seconds`. After the profiling is complete, the profiler will export the results as a JSON object.

## Generating the Memory Profile
To generate the memory profile, we will need to access the newly created endpoint in our NestJS application. Here's an example of how to do this using the `axios` module:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

(async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/profile/memory');
  console.log(response.data);
})();
```

In this code, we are sending a GET request to the `/profile/memory` endpoint of our NestJS application running on `localhost:3000`. When the response is received, we log the data to the console.

## Analyzing the Memory Profile

Once we have generated the memory profile, we can analyze it using the Chrome DevTools. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.
2. Click on the **Open dedicated DevTools for Node** link.
3. In the newly opened DevTools window, click on the **Profiler** tab.
4. Click on the **Load** button and select the memory profile JSON file generated by our NestJS application.
5. Once the profile is loaded, click on the **Summary** tab to see an overview of the memory usage.
6. Click on the **Comparison** tab to compare the memory usage of different snapshots.

In the DevTools, you can also use other tools and tabs to analyze the memory usage in more detail.
